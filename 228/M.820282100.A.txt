Hoare, Michael Rand
1993    "Taiwan Confronts Its Past, 1947 Taiwanese rebellion against
        Chinese nationalists," History Today 43 (May): 4-8.
SUMMARY: The Kuomintang took power in Taiwan when Japan surrendered in
1945, and the former Japanese colony was then run by mandarin-speaking
mainland Chinese. The Taiwanese population resisted the outsiders'
authority, and a bloody rebellion known as the '228' events ensued.

Baum, Julian and Jonathan Karp
1992    "Look back in Anger, rewriting Taiwan's history," Far Eastern
Economic Review 155.8 (Feb 27): 48-9.
ABSTRACT: Taiwan embarked on an official investigation and is
          set to release its findings on the Feb 28, 1947, uprising, in
          which 10,000 people were killed. Chiang Kai-shek's
          authoritarian rule that suppressed academic freedom has
          succeeded in making people collectively forget Taiwanese
          history and their sense of national consciousness. The report
          is particularly important since Taiwanese historians are
          exerting efforts to rewrite Taiwan's history to fill in the
          gaps that existed due to academic suppression.
