        "I did not get into Taipei until Tuesday... to the office, and then 
called at the MacKay Hospital...  Everywhere I was told tales of looting, 
shooting, murder and rape, and [I saw] trucks loaded with heavily armed 
soldiery and bearing mounted machine guns patrolling the city.  Then it was 
decided that it may become necessary to leave the island and I was asked 
to... see the British Consul, [Geoffrey Tingle, at Tamsui] and find out if we 
could leave heavy baggage in store there.  Jim Woodruff drove me down...
        That same evening Hokuto [Peitou] seemed to have been raided, and 
heavy firing went on for thirty minutes, and afterwards Chinese soldiers 
searched the roads and bush systematically up past [the UNRRA hostel].  Large 
numbers of Taiwanese were on the move up to the hills and on a few walks I 
took I found many people living out in caves.  One man explained that 
soldiers had shot his father so he had brought his family up to relative 
safety away from the town.  Apparently the soldiers did hunt some refugees 
out, as often - especially at night - short bursts of firing could be heard.
        Towards the end of the week I made one trip to Keelung - buildings 
had been damaged and Taiwanese I spoke to told stories of wholesale shooting 
and looting.  I did see Chinese police drag in the bodies of two men who had 
been shot, and Taiwanese standing about told me that very many bodies had 
been taken from the Harbor over the past week."

� Louise Tomsett, a New Zealand girl and the UNRRA (United Nations Relief and 
Rehabilitation Administration) Accounts Officer, who visited Taipei, Keelung 
and Tamsui, and reported on conditions at Peitou, site of the UNRRA residence.
