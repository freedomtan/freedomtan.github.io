        A public prosecutor - A Formosan - who had directed proceedings 
against mainland police officers guilty of murder in Taichung in 1946, was now 
seized at Taipei by the convicts themselves, who had been released after 
March 8.  The prosecutor was killed.  The Formosan judge who had sat in this 
case was dragged from the Court offices and was reported to have been 
killed.  The prominent doctor who had criticized the Tainan City mayor in a 
dramatic confrontation was slaughtered.
        As the terror proceeded, even these tenuous involvements with the 
Government were no longer needed to "justify" vengeful murder.  The Formosan 
lawyer who had won acquittal for the Japanese gynecologist Dr. Mukai in late 
1945 was now seized and shot.  At Keelung a minor employee of the Taiwan 
Navigation Company (an accountant), was taken out to the street in front of 
the offices and there shot before his assembled office colleagues...
        At Kaohsiung there were incidents in which the victims' families were 
forced to witness cruel executions in the public streets.  The nights in 
Taipei were made grim with the sounds of shooting, of screams, and 
occasionally of pleas for mercy heard as victims were driven along dark 
streets by the soldiery.
