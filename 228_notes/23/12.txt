If you ever read George Kerr's "Formosa Betrayed,"
you might run into an entry regarding the 平頭彈 being 
used by the Chinese troops.  平頭彈 has long been 
forbidden in warfare by the international world, but 
the Chinese troops undoubtedly shot this type of
bullets to the civilians in Taiwan.

The new item being exhibited in the 228 Memorial 
Museum is a collection of books which were shot and exploded 
by the aforementioned  bullet.  A Taiwanese found the books 
among the relics of a clinic in Taipei shortly after the 
massacre by the Chinese troops.  He gave the books to 
Edward Paine, who worked for the UN then and kept this
evidence to the 1990s.
