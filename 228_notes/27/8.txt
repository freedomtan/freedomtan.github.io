        "Boys were shot down from bicycles as they rode.  One man who was 
sitting in his home reading his evening newspaper had his money, watch and a 
ring removed from his person by soldiers who entered his home, and then shot 
him through the back.  The next morning as he was being carried in a 
stretcher to the hospital by his family, they were shot at, even as they 
entered the front door of the hospital - a Canadian Mission hospital...  A 
working man returning home was confronted by soldiers who had him raise his 
hands, then searched his person.  Not finding any money they ran a bayonet 
through his leg; then as he fell to the ground they demanded that he stand 
up, which he could not do.  So they shot him in the head and departed.  But 
they only shot off his ear and he was able to tell of his experiences the 
next day in the hospital ward.  Governor Chen Yi announced over the radio 
that everything was at peace again, and asked all Formosans to open their 
shops and resume work.  The next morning a half-dozen Formosans were pushing 
a cart of fish to market when Chinese troops opened fire on them from the 
roadside, killing some and wounding others.
        In the city of Pingtung where the inauguration of the brief people's 
rule was marked by the playing of the Star Spangled Banner on phonographs, 
the entire group of about 45 Formosans who were carrying on various phases of 
local government were taken out to a nearby airfield from which, later, a 
series of shots were heard.  A Formosan who, representing the families of 
these people, went to the military commander to intercede for their lives, 
was taken to the public square and, after his wife and children had been 
called to witness the event, he was beheaded as an example to the rest of the 
people not to meddle in affairs which did not concern them."
